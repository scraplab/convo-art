# SCRAP Lab Arts Integration Project: The Echo Chamber

Participants will have conversations about art and hear semantically similar utterances from other sessions 
played in real time. 

# TODO:
- [ ] Add a way to play the audio files in real time.
- [ ] Solve stuttering problem when recording audio files.
- [ ] Add special effects to recordings (e.g. reverse reverb, spectral delay, etc.)
